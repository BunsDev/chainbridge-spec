# ChainBridge Specification

Welcome to the home of the ChainBridge specifications!

- [General ChainBridge Spec](/v1.md): This is the general specification for chain requirements and the relayer software.
- [Ethereum Specification](/ethereum.md): This specifies the ChainBridge solidity implementation
- [Substrate Specification](/substrate.md): This specifies the ChainBridge substrate pallet

Implementations of these components can be found in these repos:
- [ChainBridge](https://github.com/chainsafe/chainbridge/): Go implementation of relayer software
- [chainbridge-solidity](https://github.com/chainsafe/chainbridge-solidity/): Solidity implementation of on-chain components
- [chainbridge-substrate](https://github.com/chainsafe/chainbridge-substrate/): Substrate pallet to enable bridging functionality in a Substrate runtime.
