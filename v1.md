# ChainBridge Version 1 Specification

## Summary

A high-level summary of the goals of the bridge. Including but not limited to: core functionality, design goals with respect to extensibility and modularity.

## Definitions

## Requirements of a bridgeable chain

## Extending the bridge

How to add a new chain to the bridge, ranging from trivial (eg. updating config to support another eth chain) to implementing a completely new chain with its own rules and logic.
Perhaps put this near the end, since it should be technical.

## Transfer flow

Including proposal creation and actual transfer handling. Breakdown into user vs. relayer.

#### Relayer flow

#### User flow

## On-chain state

This must be shared between every bridgeable chain.

## Messaging format

Format of `transfer` and `arbitrary` messages. With examples!

## Relayer interfaces and events

Define what methods will be called on-chain and with what data. Define events that are emitted in response to these calls (if applicable), as well as their respective data.

## User interfaces and events
